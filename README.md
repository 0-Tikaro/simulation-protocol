This is a finished collection of Minecraft CTM maps made by TikaroHD. There are no plans to expand it in the future, but some things may get small updates.

##### What are CTM maps?
CTM (Complete The Monument) are big sprawling custom worlds, where you as a player have one clear objective: find the monument and fill it up with the objective items. The objective items are hidden throughout the map, most frequently in special dungeons. A map is “beaten” once you have collected all of these items and beaten all the dungeons.

CTM maps have a standard suite of rules, which all boil down to “don’t play on peaceful and don’t abused the game too much”. You can read the full rule list I use down below:

1. Do not play on peaceful difficulty. Use Easy or higher (Normal recommended).
2. Do not use mods/glitches to give yourself an advantage.
3. Do not leave boundaries of the map (these are usually high mountains or bedrock walls).
4. Do not create nether portals.
5. Do not move or craft Ender Chests.
6. Do not cheat villager trades. Use the exact items required.
7. Your objective is to find and complete the special wool monument.
8. You cannot craft objective items for the monument, except for metal/gem blocks.

_Why is this world here, what’s its purpose? Forgotten by everyone: animals, humans, gods, it stands – a derelict of greater times. Weathered stones whisper of the sacred Monument basking under the great blue sky, yet no records remain of where it is or what is its purpose. Perhaps you can figure it out…?_

_Explore deep sprawling caverns and uncover ancient ruins left in time’s mercy. Yet be careful, for there are many things lurking out there, in the shadows. Your goal, lonely adventurer, is the so-called Monument, standing silently somewhere down below…_

### [Ligebied][link_ligebied]

<i>An old chapel stands alone, looking over the distant sea. It is said that long ago, the secret of fabled golden oaks was kept there. Perhaps it is what you seek?</i>

This map was a small experiment with some of the concepts later used in Entropy. It is not a coincidence that this map is set in the same universe as SP03 and expands some details of its lore.

_Follow your legacy as a beasthunter to the wicked lands, infested with horrible creatures, in search of great treasures: the Heirlooms of a long-lost bloodline. Retrieve them from the depths of the Old Cathedral, but be careful, as it is a dangerous place to explore alone. May you succumb to numerous monsters or explode to pieces due to a slight mistake, surely no living soul will know..._

This map was made in the span of 3 days as an entry for Strawberry Jam #06. Theme is "Traps, Trolls, & April Fools", but the map takes that theme very liberally.
