##### Introduction
This is a finished collection of Minecraft CTM maps made by TikaroHD. There are no plans to expand it in the future, but some things may get small updates.

To download the maps, click on their titles.

##### What are CTM maps?
CTM (Complete The Monument) are big sprawling custom worlds, where you as a player have one clear objective: find the monument and fill it up with the objective items. The objective items are hidden throughout the map, most frequently in special dungeons. A map is “beaten” once you have collected all of these items and beaten all the dungeons.

CTM maps have a standard suite of rules, which all boil down to “don’t play on peaceful and don’t abuse the game too much”. You can read the full list of rules I use down below:

1. Do not play on peaceful difficulty. Use Easy or higher (Normal recommended).
2. Do not use mods/glitches to give yourself an advantage.
3. Do not leave boundaries of the map (these are usually high mountains or bedrock walls).
4. Do not create nether portals.
5. Do not move or craft Ender Chests.
6. Do not cheat villager trades. Use the exact items required.
7. Your objective is to find and complete the special wool monument.
8. You cannot craft objective items for the monument, except for metal/gem blocks.

#### FULL-LENGTH CTM
These maps are the "classic" of CTM maps in terms of scale. With 15+ objectives, they offer long-term challenges with 20+ hours of gameplay time.

15 objectives |   
Made for **Minecraft 1.12 + Optifine** |   
Released on **8 June 2018** |   

_O nameless sailor, are you ready for one final journey? Sail away to the ends of the world, where the derelict of tremendous grandeur awaits. Abandoned in horror, it stands in deafening silence, waiting patiently until the dunes of insignificant dust wash it all away..._

Surviving several years of on-and-off development, this the definitive CTM experience I bring to the table. Entropy offers you a gigantic cohesive world to explore, filled to the brim with lore and hiding many secrets under its seemingly withered silent carcass. The map is spiced up with a custom-made resource pack that will require you to install Optifine to be used in its full potential.

16 objectives + 4 craftable blocks |   
Made for **Minecraft 1.7** |   
Released on **1 October 2014** |   

_Why is this world here, what’s its purpose? Forgotten by everyone: animals, humans, gods, it stands – a derelict of greater times. Weathered stones whisper of the sacred Monument basking under the great blue sky, yet no records remain of where it is or what is its purpose. Perhaps you can figure it out…?_

Before the release of Entropy, this was the definitive "TikaroHD's CTM" map. Overload is quite dated by now, but it offers a much more refined experience compared to Animosity. Better visuals and more balanced gameplay ensure that you'll have a fun time messing around with this map.

16 objectives + 4 craftable blocks |   
Made for **Minecraft 1.7** |   
Released on **14 September 2013** |   

_Explore deep sprawling caverns and uncover ancient ruins left in time’s mercy. Yet be careful, for there are many things lurking out there, in the shadows. Your goal, lonely adventurer, is the so-called Monument, standing silently somewhere down below…_

This is the very first CTM map I made. As such, it's fairly bland and does not hold up to today's standards neither in gameplay nor in visuals. Nevertheless, you are welcome to take a look to see the map which started this whole collection.

#### MINI-CTM
These are smaller maps, featuring just 3 objectives. They provide a quick challenge that will take only a couple of hours - just enough for a small weekend entertainment. Most were made for the [Strawberry Jam](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/maps/maps-discussion/2311800) events.

## [LIGEBIED][link_ligebied]

3 objectives |   
Made for **Minecraft 1.10** |   
Released on **29 April 2017** |   

_An old chapel stands alone, looking over the distant sea. It is said that long ago, the secret of fabled golden oaks was kept there. Is this what you've been looking for, by chance?_

This was an experimental map, with some of its good parts later used in Entropy, mainly the custom resource pack integration. It is not a coincidence that Ligebied is set in the same universe as SP03 and expands one of its lore subjects - the "fabled golden oaks".

Released on **12 April 2015** |   

_Follow your legacy as a beasthunter to the wicked lands, infested with horrible creatures, in search of great treasures: the Heirlooms of a long-lost bloodline. Retrieve them from the depths of the Old Cathedral, but be careful, as it is a dangerous place to explore alone. May you succumb to numerous monsters or explode to pieces due to a slight mistake, surely no living soul will know..._

This map was made in the span of 3 days as an entry for Strawberry Jam #06. Theme is "Traps, Trolls, & April Fools", but the map takes that theme very liberally.
